# Image Processing Final Project - Group 1
This project is the final project for the Image Processing course, developed by Group 1. It focuses on recognizing numbers in images using various image processing and optical character recognition (OCR) techniques. The project includes a Python file that can be run on Google Colab and a local folder containing a database of 10,000 images.

# Features
Number Recognition: The Python file (number_recognition.ipynb) allows users to capture live images from the camera or upload a local image file to recognize numbers.
Database: The my_data folder contains 10,000 images that are part of the project. These images can be used for training or testing the number recognition algorithm.

# Usage

Clone the project repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/Image-Processing_Final_Project_Group1.git

Open the number_recognition.ipynb file in Google Colab.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to capture images or load local image files for number recognition.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Tesseract OCR
Google Colab (for running the notebook)
